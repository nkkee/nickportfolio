        <p id="essence">I have the ability to fall in love with anything relating to the upliftment of youths, the environment or technology. I spend my time traveling and thinking of ways to encourage millennials to pursue their passions and unlock their true potential. I have a knack for embarking on projects that are linked to the things I really care about. I take on a very muti-disciplined approach to work, incorporating lessons learned from past failures, experiences, and teachings.<br><br>Born in the beautiful island of Jamaica, I have grown an obsession with faults of the traditional education system. I believe that it does not leave room for creative freedom, open-mindedness, and change. I am intent on influencing a revolution to bring the system back to its roots of creative expression, empathy, and awareness.<br><br>Instead of heading to college/university after high school, I decided to travel, code, research independently, attend hackathons, and build startups. <br><br><a href="#" target="_blank"><b>Facebook</b></a> <a href="#" target="_blank"><b>LinkedIn</b></a> <a href="#" target="_blank"><b>Twitter</b></a></p>
        
        <p id="work">My work expertise spans across business, technology, science and policy.

My focus shifted to independent scientific research in the niches of organic plastics and clean &amp; renewable energy. I have embarked on starting companies in the sectors of education, big data, and 3D printing. I have had the honor of working with NASA, CERN, Red Cross International and the United Nations on energy related projects and policy reforms.<br><br>I now run <a href="http://nextgencreators.com" target="_blank"><b>Next Gen Creators</b></a> - a non-profit organization aimed at promoting and creating opportunities for youths in the Caribbean and Latin America to become actively involved in technology and entrepreneurship -  full time.
